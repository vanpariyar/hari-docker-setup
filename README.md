# hari-docker-setup

## Introduction
Hi all :wave: this is the collection of the my personal docker setup files :slightly_smiling_face:	

that i am using for pluning development as well as custom wordpress themes.

## Reason for doing this 
i have to copy from internet or my old repo to setup :sweat_smile:	.

so insted of doing this i will try to add the simple as submodule

## Usage

```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/vanpariyar/hari-docker-setup 

cd hari-docker-setup

# -f OR --file FILE  use File Options
# default will use docker-compose.yaml file

sudo docker-compose up --file replace_filename_here

```
